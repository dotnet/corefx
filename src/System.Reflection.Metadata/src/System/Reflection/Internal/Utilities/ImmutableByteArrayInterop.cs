    /// A generic version of this API was once public in a pre-release of immutable 
    /// collections, but  it was deemed to be too subject to abuse when available publicly.
    /// 
    /// This implementation is scoped to byte arrays as that is all that the metadata reader needs.
    /// 
    /// Also, since we don't have access to immutable collection internals, we use a trick involving
    /// overlapping a <see cref="ImmutableArray{Byte}"/> with a <see cref="T:Byte[]"/> refer. While
    /// unverifiable, it is valid. See Ecma 335, section II.10.7 Controlling instance layout:
    /// 
    /// "It is possible to overlap fields in this way, though offsets occupied by an object reference 
    /// shall not overlap with offsets occupied by a built-in value type or a part of
    /// another object reference. While one object reference can completely overlap another, this is
    /// unverifiable."
    /// 
    /// Furthermore, the fact that <see cref="ImmutableArray{Byte}"/> backed by a single <see cref="T:Byte[]"/> 
    /// field is something inherent to the design of ImmutableArray in order to get its performance
    /// characteristics and therefore something we (Microsoft) are comfortable defining as a contract that 
    /// can be depended upon as below.
