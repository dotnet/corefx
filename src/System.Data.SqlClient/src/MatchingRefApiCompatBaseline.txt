#
# netstandard dll has been shipped with IDbColumnSchemaGenerator inherited and SqlDataReader.GetColumnScheme() implemented in source, but not exposed in ref contract.
# Removing SqlDataReader.GetColumnScheme() from netstandard implementation potentially breaks existing customer source code
# that utilizes SqlDataReader.GetColumnScheme() indirectly by casting SqlDataReader to IDbColumnSchemaGenerator type.
# In order to prevent it, the API needs to be kept in public, and following 5 error message should be remaining in this baseline file.
#
# PoolBlockingPeriod was not added until .NET Framework 4.6.2, hence, the respective APIs are netcoreapp specific only.
