    // situations, libcurl will ask us to rewind the stream.  We can do this with ReadAsStreamAsync,

    // could ask for a new stream again via calling ReadAsStreamAsync again, but it doesn't
    // do content consumption detection like you get with HttpContent.CopyToAsync.  CopyToAsync
    // is the preferred, supported mechanism for a handler getting data from the HttpContent,
    // and is what WinHttpHandler uses, but it also provides a push-based model.  In order to
    // be able to pull from a push-based model, we need an adapter stream that straddles
    // the divide.  This implementation provides that.
