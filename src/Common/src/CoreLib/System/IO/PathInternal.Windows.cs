        // All paths in Win32 ultimately end up becoming a path to a File object in the Windows object manager. Passed in paths get mapped through
        // DosDevice symbolic links in the object tree to actual File objects under \Devices. To illustrate, this is what happens with a typical
        // path "Foo" passed as a filename to any Win32 API:
        //
        //  1. "Foo" is recognized as a relative path and is appended to the current directory (say, "C:\" in our example)
        //  2. "C:\Foo" is prepended with the DosDevice namespace "\??\"
        //  3. CreateFile tries to create an object handle to the requested file "\??\C:\Foo"
        //  4. The Object Manager recognizes the DosDevices prefix and looks
        //      a. First in the current session DosDevices ("\Sessions\1\DosDevices\" for example, mapped network drives go here)
        //      b. If not found in the session, it looks in the Global DosDevices ("\GLOBAL??\")
        //  5. "C:" is found in DosDevices (in our case "\GLOBAL??\C:", which is a symbolic link to "\Device\HarddiskVolume6")
        //  6. The full path is now "\Device\HarddiskVolume6\Foo", "\Device\HarddiskVolume6" is a File object and parsing is handed off
        //      to the registered parsing method for Files
        //  7. The registered open method for File objects is invoked to create the file handle which is then returned
        //
        // There are multiple ways to directly specify a DosDevices path. The final format of "\??\" is one way. It can also be specified
        // as "\\.\" (the most commonly documented way) and "\\?\". If the question mark syntax is used the path will skip normalization
        // (essentially GetFullPathName()) and path length checks.
