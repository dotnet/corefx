/* 
   This class allows an application to fail before starting certain 
   activities.  The idea is to fail early instead of failing in the middle
   of some long-running operation to increase the survivability of the 
   application and ensure you don't have to write tricky code to handle an 
   OOM anywhere in your app's code (which implies state corruption, meaning you
   should unload the appdomain, if you have a transacted environment to ensure
   rollback of individual transactions).  This is an incomplete tool to attempt
   hoisting all your OOM failures from anywhere in your worker methods to one 
   particular point where it is easier to handle an OOM failure, and you can
   optionally choose to not start a workitem if it will likely fail.  This does 
   not help the performance of your code directly (other than helping to avoid 
   AD unloads).  The point is to avoid starting work if it is likely to fail.  
   The Enterprise Services team has used these memory gates effectively in the 
   unmanaged world for a decade.

   In Whidbey, we will simply check to see if there is enough memory available
   in the OS's page file & attempt to ensure there might be enough space free
   within the process's address space (checking for address space fragmentation
   as well).  We will not commit or reserve any memory.  To avoid race conditions with
   other threads using MemoryFailPoints, we'll also keep track of a 
   process-wide amount of memory "reserved" via all currently-active 
   MemoryFailPoints.  This has two problems:
      1) This can account for memory twice.  If a thread creates a 
         MemoryFailPoint for 100 MB then allocates 99 MB, we'll see 99 MB 
         less free memory and 100 MB less reserved memory.  Yet, subtracting 
         off the 100 MB is necessary because the thread may not have started
         allocating memory yet.  Disposing of this class immediately after 
         front-loaded allocations have completed is a great idea.
      2) This is still vulnerable to race conditions with other threads that don't use 
         MemoryFailPoints.
   So this class is far from perfect.  But it may be good enough to 
   meaningfully reduce the frequency of OutOfMemoryExceptions in managed apps.

   In Orcas or later, we might allocate some memory from the OS and add it
   to a allocation context for this thread.  Obviously, at that point we need
   some way of conveying when we release this block of memory.  So, we 
   implemented IDisposable on this type in Whidbey and expect all users to call
   this from within a using block to provide lexical scope for their memory 
   usage.  The call to Dispose (implicit with the using block) will give us an
   opportunity to release this memory, perhaps.  We anticipate this will give 
   us the possibility of a more effective design in a future version.

   In Orcas, we may also need to differentiate between allocations that would
   go into the normal managed heap vs. the large object heap, or we should 
   consider checking for enough free space in both locations (with any 
   appropriate adjustments to ensure the memory is contiguous).
