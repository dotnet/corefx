    {
        // Design:
        //
        // SingleProducerSingleConsumerQueue (SPSCQueue) is a concurrent queue designed to be used
        // by one producer thread and one consumer thread. SPSCQueue does not work correctly when used by
        // multiple producer threads concurrently or multiple consumer threads concurrently.
        //
        // SPSCQueue is based on segments that behave like circular buffers. Each circular buffer is represented
        // as an array with two indexes: m_first and m_last. m_first is the index of the array slot for the consumer
        // to read next, and m_last is the slot for the producer to write next. The circular buffer is empty when
        // (m_first == m_last), and full when ((m_last+1) % m_array.Length == m_first).
        //
        // Since m_first is only ever modified by the consumer thread and m_last by the producer, the two indices can
        // be updated without interlocked operations. As long as the queue size fits inside a single circular buffer,
        // enqueues and dequeues simply advance the corresponding indices around the circular buffer. If an enqueue finds
        // that there is no room in the existing buffer, however, a new circular buffer is allocated that is twice as big
        // as the old buffer. From then on, the producer will insert values into the new buffer. The consumer will first
        // empty out the old buffer and only then follow the producer into the new (larger) buffer.
        //
        // As described above, the enqueue operation on the fast path only modifies the m_first field of the current segment.
        // However, it also needs to read m_last in order to verify that there is room in the current segment. Similarly, the
        // dequeue operation on the fast path only needs to modify m_last, but also needs to read m_first to verify that the
        // queue is non-empty. This results in true cache line sharing between the producer and the consumer.
        //
        // The cache line sharing issue can be mitigating by having a possibly stale copy of m_first that is owned by the producer,
        // and a possibly stale copy of m_last that is owned by the consumer. So, the consumer state is described using
        // (m_first, m_lastCopy) and the producer state using (m_firstCopy, m_last). The consumer state is separated from
        // the producer state by padding, which allows fast-path enqueues and dequeues from hitting shared cache lines.
        // m_lastCopy is the consumer's copy of m_last. Whenever the consumer can tell that there is room in the buffer
        // simply by observing m_lastCopy, the consumer thread does not need to read m_last and thus encounter a cache miss. Only
        // when the buffer appears to be empty will the consumer refresh m_lastCopy from m_last. m_firstCopy is used by the producer
        // in the same way to avoid reading m_first on the hot path.
