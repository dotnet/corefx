// Helper methods for using Tasks to implement the APM pattern.

// Example usage, wrapping a Task<int>-returning FooAsync method with Begin/EndFoo methods:
//
//     public IAsyncResult BeginFoo(..., AsyncCallback callback, object state) =>
//         TaskToApm.Begin(FooAsync(...), callback, state);
//
//     public int EndFoo(IAsyncResult asyncResult) =>
//         TaskToApm.End<int>(asyncResult);
