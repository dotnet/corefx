    // SpinWait is just a little value type that encapsulates some common spinning
    // logic. It ensures we always yield on single-proc machines (instead of using busy
    // waits), and that we work well on HT. It encapsulates a good mixture of spinning
    // and real yielding. It's a value type so that various areas of the engine can use
    // one by allocating it on the stack w/out unnecessary GC allocation overhead, e.g.:
    //
    //     void f() {
    //         SpinWait wait = new SpinWait();
    //         while (!p) { wait.SpinOnce(); }
    //         ...
    //     }
    //
    // Internally it just maintains a counter that is used to decide when to yield, etc.
    // 
    // A common usage is to spin before blocking. In those cases, the NextSpinWillYield
    // property allows a user to decide to fall back to waiting once it returns true:
    // 
    //     void f() {
    //         SpinWait wait = new SpinWait();
    //         while (!p) {
    //             if (wait.NextSpinWillYield) { /* block! */ }
    //             else { wait.SpinOnce(); }
    //         }
