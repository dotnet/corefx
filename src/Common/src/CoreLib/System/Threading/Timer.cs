    // TimerQueue maintains a list of active timers.  We use a single native timer to schedule all managed timers
    // in the process.
    //
    // Perf assumptions:  We assume that timers are created and destroyed frequently, but rarely actually fire.
    // There are roughly two types of timer:
    //
    //  - timeouts for operations.  These are created and destroyed very frequently, but almost never fire, because
    //    the whole point is that the timer only fires if something has gone wrong.
    //
    //  - scheduled background tasks.  These typically do fire, but they usually have quite long durations.
    //    So the impact of spending a few extra cycles to fire these is negligible.
    //
    // Because of this, we want to choose a data structure with very fast insert and delete times, and we can live
    // with linear traversal times when firing timers.  However, we still want to minimize the number of timers
    // we need to traverse while doing the linear walk: in cases where we have lots of long-lived timers as well as
    // lots of short-lived timers, when the short-lived timers fire, they incur the cost of walking the long-lived ones.
    //
    // The data structure we've chosen is an unordered doubly-linked list of active timers.  This gives O(1) insertion
    // and removal, and O(N) traversal when finding expired timers.  We maintain two such lists: one for all of the
    // timers that'll next fire within a certain threshold, and one for the rest.
    //
    // Note that all instance methods of this class require that the caller hold a lock on the TimerQueue instance.
    // We partition the timers across multiple TimerQueues, each with its own lock and set of short/long lists,
    // in order to minimize contention when lots of threads are concurrently creating and destroying timers often.
