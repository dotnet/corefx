    // ManualResetEventSlim wraps a manual-reset event internally with a little bit of
    // spinning. When an event will be set imminently, it is often advantageous to avoid
    // a 4k+ cycle context switch in favor of briefly spinning. Therefore we layer on to
    // a brief amount of spinning that should, on the average, make using the slim event
    // cheaper than using Win32 events directly. This can be reset manually, much like
    // a Win32 manual-reset would be.
    //
    // Notes:
    //     We lazily allocate the Win32 event internally. Therefore, the caller should
    //     always call Dispose to clean it up, just in case. This API is a no-op of the
    //     event wasn't allocated, but if it was, ensures that the event goes away
    //     eagerly, instead of waiting for finalization.
