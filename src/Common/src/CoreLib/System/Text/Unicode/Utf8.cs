         * OperationStatus-based APIs for transcoding of chunked data.
         * This method is similar to Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes / GetChars but has a
         * different calling convention, different error handling mechanisms, and
         * different performance characteristics.
         *
         * If 'replaceInvalidSequences' is true, the method will replace any ill-formed
         * subsequence in the source with U+FFFD when transcoding to the destination,
         * then it will continue processing the remainder of the buffers. Otherwise
         * the method will return OperationStatus.InvalidData.
         *
         * If the method does return an error code, the out parameters will represent
         * how much of the data was successfully transcoded, and the location of the
         * ill-formed subsequence can be deduced from these values.
         *
         * If 'replaceInvalidSequences' is true, the method is guaranteed never to return
         * OperationStatus.InvalidData. If 'isFinalBlock' is true, the method is
         * guaranteed never to return OperationStatus.NeedMoreData.
