    // It was decided not to make the delegate and state into weak references because:
    //    - The delegate is very likely to be abandoned by the user right after calling BeginXxx, making caching it useless. There's
    //         no easy way to weakly reference just the target.
    //    - We want to support identifying state via object.Equals() (especially value types), which means we need to keep a
    //         reference to the original.  Plus, if we're holding the target, might as well hold the state too.
    // The user will need to disable caching if they want their target/state to be instantly collected.
    //
    // For now the state is not included as part of the closure.  It is too common a pattern (for example with socket receive)
    // to have several pending IOs differentiated by their state object.  We don't want that pattern to break the cache.
