    // RFC 2822 Section 3.2.2 - Quoted Characters
    // As in C# strings, characters that would otherwise have special meaning should be ignored when quoted/escaped 
    // by a backslash "\". Quoted characters (quoted-pair) are only allowed in the following contexts: Comments, 
    // quoted-string, domain-literal, and message-id. 
    // 
    // Example: A quoted-string ("hello there") cannot contain a double quote, as it must be surrounded by them.
    //  However, the double quote can be included as a quoted-pair: ("hello\"there") means (hello"there).
    //
    // Because backslashes themselves can be quoted-pairs (\\), this class's primary function is to verify what 
    // character is being quoted. In "hi\\\\a", 'a' is not quoted because all of the backslashes are paired together.
    // In "hi\\\a", 'a' is quoted.

        //
        // Return value: 
        // - 0 if the char at data[index] was not quoted 
        //   e.g. (\\a) given index=2 returns 0 because 'a' is not quoted
        // - The number of consecutive quoted chars, including multiple preceding quoted backslashes
        //   e.g. (a\\\b) given index=4 returns 4, as 'b' is quoted, and so are the previous backslashes

        // Throws a FormatException if the an escaped Unicode character is found but was not permitted.
