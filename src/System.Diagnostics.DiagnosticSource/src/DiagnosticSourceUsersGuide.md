# DiagnosticSource Users Guide

This document describes DiagnosticSource, a simple module that allows code 
to be instrumented for production-time logging of **rich data payloads** for 
consumption **within the process** that was instrumented.   At runtime consumers
can **dynamically discover** data sources and subscribe to the ones of interest.  

In addition to background on how the class works, this document also covers 
[naming conventions](#naming-conventions) and [best practices](#best-practices) when 
instrumenting code.     

-------------------------------------------
## Relationship to Other Logging Facilities 

In addition to DiagnosticSource, there are two other logging systems provided by Microsoft:

  1. EventSource [docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource(v=vs.110).aspx) 
	 and [src](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/DiagnosticSourceEventSource.cs).
	 EventSource has been available since V4.5 of the .NET Runtime and is what is used
	 to instrument the runtime itself.   It is designed to be fast and to be strongly
	 typed (payloads are typed, named properties), and to interface with OS logging
	 infrastructure like Event Tracing for Windows [(ETW)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363668(v=vs.85).aspx)
	 or [LTTng](http://lttng.org/) on Linux.   

  2. ILogger [src](https://github.com/aspnet/logging).  A number of popular 3rd party 
     formatted string logging systems for .NET have been built including NLog SeriLog
	 and Log4Net.    The ILogger Nuget package is designed to 'wrap' any of these and 
	 hide from the instrumentation code which exact logging system is being used.   Using
	 this wrapper makes the most sense if your goal is to 'plug into' a logging pipeline
	 that assumes one of these logging systems.   
  
DiagnosticSource has more architectural similarity to EventSource.  The main difference
is that EventSource assumes that the data being logged will **leave the process** and thus
requires that **only serializable data** be logged.   However, DiagnosticSource was designed
to allow in-process tools to get at very rich data.   Because the consumer is assumed to be
within the same process, non-serializable types (e.g. HttpResponseMessage or HttpContext)
can be passed, which gives the consumer a lot of potential data to work with.    

As explained in [Bridge to EventSource](bridge-to-eventSource), there is a bridge that
pipes information from DiagnosticSource's to an EventSource.   Thus EventSource
consumers can get at all DiagnosticSource events.    While the data payloads from 
DiagnosticSource can't in general be passed through to the EventSource (because they are 
not serializable), there is a mechanism in the bridge that enables consumers to specify which fields
along to the EventSource.  

What this means is that in general it is not necessary to instrument a code site multiple
times.   By instrumenting with Diagnostic source, both clients that need the rich data
(and thus use DiagnosticListener) as well as any consumers using EventListeners 
(or OS facilities like ETW)) can get at the data.  

----------------------------------------
## Instrumenting with DiagnosticSource/DiagnosticListener

Perhaps surprisingly, the heart of DiagnosticSource logging architecture is not the
DiagnosticSource class but rather the DiagnosticListener class which 'receives' the 
events.    This is because the DiagnosticSource type is just an abstract base class
that defines the methods needed to actually log events.    It is the  DiagnosticListener
which holds all the actual implementation.

Thus the first step in instrumenting code with DiagnosticSource is to create a 
DiagnosticListener.   For example

```C#
    private static DiagnosticSource httpLogger = new DiagnosticListener("System.Net.Http");
```
Notice that httpLogger is typed as a DiagnosticSource.    This is because this code
only cares about writing events and thus only cares about the  DiagnosticSource methods that
the DiagnosticListener implements.   DiagnosticListeners are given names when they are created
and this name should be the name of logical grouping of related events (typically the component).
Later this name is used to find the Listener and subscribe to any of its events.  

Once you have an instance of a DiagnosticSource, logging is very straightforward.  The
interface consists of only two methods.  

```C#
	bool IsEnabled(string name)
	void Write(string name, object value);
```

A typical call site will look like

```C#
	if (httpLogger.IsEnabled("RequestStart"))
		httpLogger.Write("RequestStart", new { Url="http://clr", Request=aRequest });
```

Already some of the architectural elements are being exposed, namely

	1. Every event has a string name (e.g. Request Start), and exactly one object as a payload.
	2. If you need to send more than one item, you can do so by creating a object with all information
	   in it as properties.   CSharp's [anonymous type](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397696.aspx)
	   feature is typically used to create a type to pass 'on the fly', and makes this scheme very
	   convenient.     
	3. At the instrumentation site, you must guard the call to 'Write' with an 'IsEnabled' check on 
       the same event name.   Without this check, even when the instrumentation is inactive, the rules
	   of the C# language require all the work of creating the payload object and calling 'Write' to be 
	   done, even though nothing is actually listening for the data. By guarding the 'Write' call, we 
	   make it efficient when the source is not enabled.   

### Creating DiagnosticSources (Actually DiagnosticListeners)

Perhaps confusingly you make a DiagnosticSource by creating a DiagnosticListener

	static DiagnosticSource mySource = new DiagnosticListener("System.Net.Http");

Basically a DiagnosticListener is a named place where a source sends its information (events).  
From an implementation point of view, DiagnosticSource is a abstract class that has the two
instrumentation methods, and DiagnosticListener is something that implements that abstract class.
Thus every DiagnosticListener is a DiagnosticSource, and by making a DiagnosticListener you 
implicitly make a DiagnosticSource as well. 

DiagnosticListeners have a name, which is used to represent the component associated with the event.
Thus the event names only need to be unique within a component.  

----------------------------------------
## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

#### DiagnosticListener Names

 * CONSIDER - the likely scenarios for USING information when deciding how may 
   DiagnosticListener to have and the events in each.   Keep in mind that it is **very easy
   and efficient** to filter all the events in a particular listener so ideally the 
   most important scenarios involve turning on whole listeners and not needing to filter
   for particular events.    You may need to split
   a source into multiple smaller ones to achieve this, and this is OK.   For example there
   are both incomming Http request and outgoing Http requests and you may only need one 
   or the other, so having a System.Net.Http.Incomming and System.Net.Http.OutGoing for
   each sub-case is good.  

 * CONSIDER -  the likely volume of events.   High volume events may deserve their own
   DiagnosticListener.   You don't really want to mix high volume and low volume events
   in the same listener unless they both support the same scenario.   It is OK however to
   put several **low volume** events in a 'miscellaneous' listener, even if they support different 
   scenarios if it simplifies things enough.

 * DO - Consider the scenario when picking the name for the DiagnosticListener.  Often, this
   name is the component in which the DiagnosticListener lives, but **usage scenarios trump
   component naming**.   You want it to be the case that users can correctly guess which
   listeners to activate knowing just their scenario.   
   
 * DO - Make the name for the DiagnosticListeners **globally unique**.   This is Typically
   done by making the first part of the name the component (e.g. System.Net.Http) 

 * DO - Use dots '.' to create multi-part names.   This works well if the name is a Name
   of a component (which uses dots).  
 
 * DO NOT - name the listener after the Listener (thus something like System.Net.HttpDiagnosticListener
   is bad).   

#### EventNames 

 * DO - keep the names reasonably short (< 16 characters).   Keep in mind that that event names 
   are already qualified by the Listener so the name only needs to be unique within a listener. 
   Short names make the 'IsEnabled' faster.  

 * DO - use the 'Start' and 'Stop' suffixes for events that define an interval of time.  For example   
   naming one event 'RequestStart' and the another 'RequestStop' is good because tools can use the
   convention to determine that the time interval betweeen them is interesting.  

### payloads

  * DO use the anonymous type syntax 'new { property1 =value1 ...}' as the default way to pass 
   a payload *even if there is only one data element*.   This makes adding more data later easy
   and compatible.  

  * CONSIDER - if you have an event that is so frequent that the performance of the logging is 
   a important consideration,  **and** you have only one data item **and** it is unlikely that 
   you will ever have more data to pass to the event, **and** and the data item is a normal class
   (not a value type) **then** you save some cost by simply by passing the data object directly
   without using an anonymous type wrapper.   

  * DO - use standard names for particular payload items.   (TODO: Put the list here as we define standard payload names).
  
### Filtering
 
 * DO - always enclose the Write() call in a call to 'IsEnabled' for the same event name.  Otherwise
   a lot of setup logic will be called even if there is nothing listening for the event.

 * CONSIDER - enclosing IsEnabled(string, object, object) calls with pure IsEnabled(string) call to avoid
  extra cost of creating context in case consumer is not interested in such events at all.
 
 * CONSIDER - passing public named types instances to 'IsEnabled' overloads with object parameters
  to keep IsEnabled as efficient as possible.

 * DO - when subscribing to DiagnosticSource with advanced filter for event name and extended context, 
  make sure filter returns true for null context properties if consumer is interested
  in at least some events with context

### Other Conventions 

  * DO NOT - make the DiagnosticListener public.   There is no need to as subscribers will 
  use the AllListener property to hook up. 

 ----------------------------------------
## Consuming Data with DiagnosticListener. 

Up until now, this guide has focused on how to instrument code to generate logging
information.   In this section we focus on subscribing and decoding of that information.

### Discovery of DiagnosticListeners.   

The first step in receiving events is to discover which DiagnosticListeners you are
interested in.    While it is possible to discover DiagnosticListeners  at compile time 
by referencing static variables (e.g. like the httpLogger in the previous example), this
is typically not flexible enough.   

Instead DiagnosticListener supports a way of discovering DiagnosticListener that is
active in the system at runtime.   The API to accomplish this is the 'AllListeners' 
IObservable\<DiagnosticListener>.     

The IObservable interface is the 'callback' version of the IEnumerable interface.   You can learn 
more about it at the [Reactive Extensions Site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx).
In a nutshell, you have an object called an IObserver which has three callbacks, OnNext, OnComplete
and OnError, and an IObservable has single method called 'Subscribe' which gets passed one of these
Observers.   Once connected, the Observer gets callback (mostly OnNext callbacks) when things 
happen.   By including the System.Reactive.Core Nuget package, you can get a bunch of useful 
Extensions that make using IObservable nice.   

A typical use of the AllListeners static property looks like this:

```C#
	// We are using  to turn a Action<DiagnosticListener> into a IObserver<DiagnosticListener>  
	static IDisposable listenerSubscription = DiagnosticListener.AllListeners.Subscribe(delegate (DiagnosticListener listener)
	{
		// We get a callback of every Diagnostics Listener that is active in the system (past present or future)
		if (listener.Name == "System.Net.Http")
		{
			// Here is where we put code to subscribe to the Listener. 
		}
	});

	// Typically you leave the listenerSubscription subscription active forever.   
	// However when you no longer want your callback to be called, you can 
	// call listenerSubscription.Dispose() to cancel your subscription to the IObservable.  
```

This code basically creates a callback delegate and using the 'AllListeners.Subscribe' method requests
that that delegate be called for every active DiagnosticListener in the system.   Typically you inspect
the name of the listener and based on that, decide whether to subscribe to listener or not.  The
code above is looking for our 'System.Net.Http' listener that we created previously.

Like all calls to Subscribe, this one returns a IDisposable that represents the subscription itself.
Callbacks will continue to happen as long as nothing calls Dispose() on this subscription object.   
The above code never calls it, so it will receive callbacks forever.  

It is important to note that when you Subscribe to AllListeners, you get a callback for ALL ACTIVE DiagnosticListeners.
Thus upon subscribing you get a flurry of callbacks of all existing DiagnosticListeners but as new ones
are created, you get a callback for those as well.   Thus you get a complete list of everything it is possible
to subscribe to.  

Finally, note that the code above is taking advantage of convenience functionality in the System.Reactive.Core
library.   The DiagnosticListener.AllListeners.Subscribe method actually requires that it be passed
an IObserver\<DiagnosticListener>, which is a class that has three callbacks (OnNext, OnError, OnComplete),
but we passed it an Action\<DiagnosticListener>.   The magic that makes this work is an extension method
in System.Reactive.Core that takes the Action and from it makes an IObserver (called AnonymousObserver) 
which calls the Action on its OnNext callback.   This glue is what makes the code concise.  

#### Subscribing to DiagnosticListeners

A DiagnosticListener implements the IObservable\<KeyValuePair\<string, object>> interface, so you can
call 'Subscribe' on it as well.  Thus we can fill out the previous example a bit 

```C#
	static IDisposable networkSubscription = null;
	static IDisposable listenerSubscription = DiagnosticListener.AllListeners.Subscribe(delegate (DiagnosticListener listener)
	{
		if (listener.Name == "System.Net.Http")
		{
			lock(allListeners)
			{
				if (networkSubscription != null)
					networkSubscription.Dispose();

				networkSubscription = listener.Subscribe((KeyValuePair<string, object> evnt) => 
					Console.WriteLine("From Listener {0} Received Event {1} with payload {2}", 
					networkListener.Name, evnt.Key, evnt.Value.ToString()));
			}
		}
	});

	// At some point you may wish to dispose the networkSubscription.
```

In this example after finding the 'System.Net.Http' DiagnosticListener, we create an action that 
prints out the name of the listener, event, and payload.ToString().   Notice a few things:

   1. DiagnosticListener implement IObservable\<KeyValuePair\<string, object>>.   This means 
      on each callback we get a KeyValuePair.  The key of this pair is the name of the event
	  and the value is the payload object.  In the code above we simply log this information
	  to the Console.  
   2. We keep track of our subscriptions to the DiagnosticListeners.   In this case we have
      a networkSubscription variable that remembers this, and we get another 'creation' we
	  unsubscribe the previous listener and subscribe to the new one.  
   3. We use locks.   The DiagnosticSource/DiagnosticListener code is thread safe, but the 
      callback code also needs to be threadsafe.   It is possible that two DiagnosticListener 
	  with the same name are created at the same time (although that is a bit unexpected), so
	  to avoid races we do updates of our shared variables under the protection of a lock.  
  
Once the above code is run, the next time a 'Write' is done on 'System.Net.Http' DiagnosticListener
the information will be logged to the Console.   

It is also important to note that subscriptions are independent of one another.  Thus other code
can do exactly the same thing as the code above, and thus generate two 'pipes' of the logging
information.   

#### Decoding Payloads

The KeyvaluePair that is passed to the callback has the event name and payload, but the payload is typed simply as 
an object.   Odds are that you want to get at more specific data.   There are two ways of doing this
	
	1. If the payload is a well known type (e.g. a string, or an HttpMessageRequest) then you can simply
	   cast the object to the expected type (using the 'as' operator so as not to cause an exception if
	   you are wrong) and then access the fields.  This is very efficient.
	2. Use reflection API, for example if we assuming we have the method 

```C#
	/// Define a shortcut method that fetches a field of a particular name. 
	static class PropertyExtensions
    {
        static object GetProperty(this object _this, string propertyName)
        {
            return _this.GetType().GetTypeInfo().GetDeclaredProperty(propertyName)?.GetValue(_this);
        }
    }
```

Then we could replace the listener.Subscribe call above with the following code, to decode the payload more fully.  

```C#
	networkSubscription = listener.Subscribe(delegate(KeyValuePair<string, object> evnt) {
		var eventName = evnt.Key;
		var payload = evnt.Value;
		if (eventName == "RequestStart")
		{
			var url = payload.GetProperty("Url") as string;
			var request = payload.GetProperty("Request");
			Console.WriteLine("Got RequestStart with URL {0} and Request {1}", url, request);
		}
	});
``` 

Note that using reflection is relatively expensive.  However using reflection is your only
option if the payloads was generated using anonymous types.   You can reduce this overhead by 
making fast, specialized property fetchers  either using PropertyInfo.CreateDelegate or 
ReflectEmit, but that is beyond the scope of this document.  (see the [PropertySpec](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/DiagnosticSourceEventSource.cs#L784) class used in the DiagnosticSourceEventSource for an example of a fast, delegate-based
property fetcher).  

#### Filtering 
 
In the example above the code uses the IObservable.Subscribe to hook up the callback, which
causes all events to be given to the callback.   However DiagnosticListener has a overloads of 
Subscribe that allow the controller to control which events get through.

Thus we could replace the listener.Subscribe call in the previous example with the following 
code

```C#
	// Create the callback delegate
	Action<KeyValuePair<string, object>> callback = (KeyValuePair<string, object> evnt) => 
		Console.WriteLine("From Listener {0} Received Event {1} with payload {2}", networkListener.Name, evnt.Key, evnt.Value.ToString());

	// Turn it into an observer (using System.Reactive.Core's AnonymousObserver)
	Observer<KeyValuePair<string, object>> observer = new AnonymousObserver<KeyValuePair<string, object>>(callback);

	// Create a predicate (asks only for one kind of event)
	Predicate<string> predicate = (string eventName) => eventName == "RequestStart";

	// Subscribe with a filter predicate
	IDisposable subscription = listener.Subscribe(observer, predicate);

	// subscription.Dispose() to stop the callbacks.  
```
Which very efficiently only subscribes to the 'RequestStart' events.   All other events will cause the DiagnosticSource.IsEnabled()
method to return false, and thus be efficiently filtered out.  

##### Context-based Filtering
Some scenarios require advanced filtering based on extended context. 
Producers may call DiagnosticSource.IsEnabled() overloads and supply additional event properties.

```C#
	if (httpLogger.IsEnabled("RequestStart", aRequest, anActivity))
		httpLogger.Write("RequestStart", new { Url="http://clr", Request=aRequest });
```

And consumers may use such properties to filter events more precisely.

```C#
    // Create a predicate (asks only for Requests for certains URIs)
    Func<string, object, object, bool> predicate = (string eventName, object context, object activity) => 
    {
        if (eventName == "RequestStart")
        {
		    HttpRequestMessage request = context as HttpRequestMessage;
		    if (request != null)
            {
                return IsUriEnabled(request.RequestUri);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Subscribe with a filter predicate
    IDisposable subscription = listener.Subscribe(observer, predicate);
```

Note that producer is not aware of filter consumer has provided. DiagnosticListener 
will invoke provided filter ommiting additional arguments if necessary, thus the filter
should expect to receive null context.
Producers should enclose IsEnabled call with event name and context with pure IsEnabled
call for event name, so consumers must ensure that filter allows events without context
to pass through.

----------------------------------------
## Consuming DiagnosticSource Data with EventListeners and ETW

The System.Diagnostic.DiagnosticSource Nuget package comes with a built in EventSource 
called Microsoft-Diagnostics-DiagnosticSource.  This EventSource has the ability to 
subscribe to any DiagnosticListener as well as pluck off particular data items from 
DiagnosticSource payloads.   

Thus code that is using System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventListener or ETW can get at 
any information logged with DiagnosticSource.   

See [DiagnosticSourceEventSource](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/DiagnosticSourceEventSource.cs)
for more information on how to use it.
