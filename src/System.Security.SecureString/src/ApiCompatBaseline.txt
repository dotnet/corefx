Compat issues with assembly System.Security.SecureString:
# This one is needed because when ApiCompat looks for the type, it will first check the v4.6 targetting pack and find the System.Runtime.InteropServices file
# which is not the latest (the one we just built) and it will load that instead of the one built inside CoreFx.
TypesMustExist : Type 'System.Security.SecureStringMarshal' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
