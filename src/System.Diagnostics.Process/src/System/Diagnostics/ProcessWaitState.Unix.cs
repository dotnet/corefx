    // Overview
    // --------
    // We have a few constraints we're working under here:
    // - waitid is used on Unix to get the exit status (including exit code) of a child process, but once a child
    //   process is reaped, it is no longer possible to get the status.
    // - The Process design allows for multiple independent Process objects to be handed out, and each of those
    //   objects may be used concurrently with each other, even if they refer to the same underlying process.
    //   Same with ProcessWaitHandle objects.  This is based on the Windows design where anyone with a handle to the
    //   process can retrieve completion information about that process.
    // - There is no good Unix equivalent to asynchronously be notified of a non-child process' exit, which means such
    //   support needs to be layered on top of kill.
    // 
    // As a result, we have the following scheme:
    // - We maintain a static/shared table that maps process ID to ProcessWaitState objects.
    //   Access to this table requires taking a global lock, so we try to minimize the number of
    //   times we need to access the table, primarily just the first time a Process object needs
    //   access to process exit/wait information and subsequently when that Process object gets GC'd.
    // - Each process holds a ProcessWaitState.Holder object; when that object is constructed,
    //   it ensures there's an appropriate entry in the mapping table and increments that entry's ref count.
    // - When a Process object is dropped and its ProcessWaitState.Holder is finalized, it'll
    //   decrement the ref count, and when no more process objects exist for a particular process ID,
    //   that entry in the table will be cleaned up.
    // - This approach effectively allows for multiple independent Process objects for the same process ID to all
    //   share the same ProcessWaitState.  And since they are sharing the same wait state object,
    //   the wait state object uses its own lock to protect the per-process state.  This includes
    //   caching exit / exit code / exit time information so that a Process object for a process that's already
    //   had waitpid called for it can get at its exit information.
    // - When we detect a recycled pid, we remove that ProcessWaitState from the table and replace it with a new one
    //   that represents the new process. For child processes we know a pid is recycled when we see the pid of a new
    //   child is already in the table. For non-child processes, we assume that a pid may be recycled as soon as
    //   we've observed it has exited.
