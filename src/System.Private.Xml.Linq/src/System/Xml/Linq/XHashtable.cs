    /// This is a thread-safe hash table which maps string keys to values of type TValue.  It is assumed that the string key is embedded in the hashed value
    /// and can be extracted via a call to ExtractKeyDelegate (in order to save space and allow cleanup of key if value is released due to a WeakReference
    /// TValue releasing its target).
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// All methods on this class are thread-safe.
    ///
    /// When the hash table fills up, it is necessary to resize it and rehash all contents.  Because this can be expensive,
    /// a lock is taken, and one thread is responsible for the resize.  Other threads which need to add values must wait
    /// for the resize to be complete.
    ///
    /// Thread-Safety Notes
    /// ===================
    ///
    /// 1. Because performance and scalability are such a concern with the global name table, I have avoided the use of
    ///    BIFALOs (Big Fat Locks).  Instead, I use CompareExchange, Interlocked.Increment, memory barriers, atomic state objects,
    ///    etc. to avoid locks.  Any changes to code which accesses these variables should be carefully reviewed and tested,
    ///    as it can be *very* tricky.  In particular, if you don't understand the CLR memory model or if you don't know
    ///    what a memory barrier is, DON'T attempt to modify this code.  A good discussion of these topics can be found at
    ///    <![CDATA[http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0203B&L=DOTNET&P=R375]]>. 
    ///
    /// 2. Because I am not sure if the CLR spec has changed since versions 1.0/1.1, I am assuming the weak memory model that
    ///    is described in the ECMA spec, in which normal writes can be reordered.  This means I must introduce more memory
    ///    barriers than otherwise would be necessary.
    ///
    /// 3. There are several thread-safety concepts and patterns I utilize in this code:
    ///      a. Publishing -- There are a small number of places where state is exposed, or published, to multiple threads.
    ///                       These places are marked with the comment "PUBLISH", and are key locations to consider when
    ///                       reviewing the code for thread-safety.
    ///
    ///      b. Immutable objects -- Immutable objects initialize their fields once in their constructor and then never modify
    ///                              them again.  As long as care is taken to ensure that initial field values are visible to
    ///                              other threads before publishing the immutable object itself, immutable objects are
    ///                              completely thread-safe.
    ///
    ///      c. Atomic state objects -- Locks typically are taken when several pieces of state must be updated atomically.  In
    ///                                 other words, there is a window in which state is inconsistent, and that window must
    ///                                 be protected from view by locking.  However, if a new object is created each time state
    ///                                 changes (or state changes substantially), then during creation the new object is only
    ///                                 visible to a single thread.  Once construction is complete, an assignment (guaranteed
    ///                                 atomic) can replace the old state object with the new state object, thus publishing a
    ///                                 consistent view to all threads.
    ///
    ///      d. Retry -- When several threads contend over shared state which only one is allowed to possess, it is possible
    ///                  to avoid locking by repeatedly attempting to acquire the shared state.  The CompareExchange method
    ///                  is useful for atomically ensuring that only one thread succeeds, and other threads are notified that
    ///                  they must retry.
