    /// <summary>
    /// A MetadataLoadContext represents a closed universe of Type objects loaded for inspection-only purposes.
    /// Each MetadataLoadContext can have its own binding rules and is isolated from all other MetadataLoadContexts.
    ///
    /// A MetadataLoadContext serves as a dictionary that binds assembly names to Assembly instances that were previously
    /// loaded into the context or need to be loaded.
    ///
    /// Assemblies are treated strictly as metadata. There are no restrictions on loading assemblies based
    /// on target platform, CPU architecture or pointer size. There are no restrictions on the assembly designated
    /// as the core assembly ("mscorlib").
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Also, as long as the metadata is "syntactically correct", the MetadataLoadContext strives to report it "as is" (as long it
    /// can do so in a way that can be distinguished from valid data) and refrains from judging whether it's "executable."
    /// This is both for performance reasons (checks cost time) and its intended role as metadata inspection tool.
    /// Examples of things that MetadataLoadContexts let go unchecked include creating generic instances that violate generic
    /// parameter constraints, and loading type hierachies that would be unloadable in an actual runtime (deriving from sealed classes,
    /// overriding members that don't exist in the ancestor classes, failing to implement all abstract methods, etc.)
    ///
    /// You cannot invoke methods, set or get field or property values or instantiate objects using
    /// the Type objects from a MetadataLoadContext. You can however, use FieldInfo.GetRawConstantValue(),
    /// ParameterInfo.RawDefaultValue and PropertyInfo.GetRawConstantValue(). You can retrieve custom attributes
    /// in CustomAttributeData format but not as instantiated custom attributes. The CustomAttributeExtensions
    /// extension api will not work with these Types nor will the IsDefined() family of api.
    ///
    /// There is no default binding policy. You must use a MetadataAssemblyResolver-derived class to load dependencies as needed.
    /// The MetadataLoadContext strives to avoid loading dependencies unless needed.
    /// Therefore, it is possible to do useful analysis of an assembly even
    /// in the absence of dependencies. For example, retrieving an assembly's name and the names of its (direct)
    /// dependencies can be done without having any of those dependencies on hand.
    ///
    /// To bind assemblies, the MetadataLoadContext calls the Resolve method on the correspding MetadataAssemblyResolver.
    /// That method should load the requested assembly and return it.
    /// To do this, it can use LoadFromAssemblyPath() or one of its variants (LoadFromStream(), LoadFromByteArray()).
    ///
    /// Once an assembly has been bound, no assembly with the same assembly name identity
    /// can be bound again from a different location unless the Mvids are identical.
    ///
    /// Once loaded, the underlying file may be locked for the duration of the MetadataLoadContext's lifetime. You can
    /// release the locks by disposing the MetadataLoadContext object. The behavior of any Type, Assembly or other reflection
    /// objects handed out by the MetadataLoadContext is undefined after disposal. Though objects provided by the MetadataLoadContext
    /// strive to throw an ObjectDisposedException, this is not guaranteed. Some apis may return fixed or previously
    /// cached data. Accessing objects *during* a Dispose may result in a unmanaged access violation and failfast.
    ///
    /// Comparing Type, Member and Assembly objects:
    ///   The right way to compare two Reflection objects dispensed by the MetadataLoadContext are:
    ///       m1 == m2
    ///       m1.Equals(m2)
    ///   but not
    ///       object.ReferenceEquals(m1, m2)   /// WRONG
    ///       (object)m1 == (object)m2         /// WRONG
    ///
    ///   Note that the following descriptions are not literal descriptions of how Equals() is implemented. The MetadataLoadContext
    ///   reserves the right to implement Equals() as "object.ReferenceEquals()" and intern the associated objects in such
    ///   a way that Equals() works "as if" it were comparing those things.
    ///
    /// - Each MetadataLoadContext permits only one Assembly instance per assembly identity so equality of assemblies is the same as the
    ///   equality of their assembly identity.
    /// 
    /// - Modules are compared by comparing their containing assemblies and their row indices in the assembly's manifest file table.
    /// 
    /// - Defined types are compared by comparing their containing modules and their row indices in the module's TypeDefinition table.
    /// 
    /// - Constructed types (arrays, byrefs, pointers, generic instances) are compared by comparing all of their component types.
    /// 
    /// - Generic parameter types are compared by comparing their containing Modules and their row indices in the module's GenericParameter table.
    /// 
    /// - Constructors, methods, fields, events and properties are compared by comparing their declaring types, their row indices in their respective
    ///   token tables and their ReflectedType property.
    /// 
    /// - Parameters are compared by comparing their declaring member and their position index.
    ///
    /// Multithreading:
    ///   The MetadataLoadContext and the reflection objects it hands out are all multithread-safe and logically immutable,
    ///   except that no Loads or inspections of reflection objects can be done during or after disposing the owning MetadataLoadContext.
    ///
    /// Support for NetCore Reflection apis:
    ///   .NETCore added a number of apis (IsSZArray, IsVariableBoundArray, IsTypeDefinition, IsGenericTypeParameter, IsGenericMethodParameter,
    ///      HasSameMetadataDefinitionAs, to name a few.) to the Reflection surface area.
    ///
    ///   The Reflection objects dispensed by MetadataLoadContexts support all the new apis *provided* that you are using the netcore build of System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext.dll.
    ///
    ///   If you are using the netstandard build of System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext.dll, the NetCore-specific apis are not supported. Attempting to invoke
    ///   them will generate a NotImplementedException or NullReferenceException (unfortunately, we can't improve the exceptions thrown because
