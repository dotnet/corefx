/**
 * Error codes returned via ConvertErrno.
 *
 * Only the names (without the PAL_ prefix) are specified by POSIX.
 *
 * The values chosen below are simply assigned arbitrarily (originally
 * in alphabetical order they appear in the spec, but they can't change so
 * add new values to the end!).
 *
 * Also, the values chosen are deliberately outside the range of
 * typical UNIX errnos (small numbers), HRESULTs (negative for errors)
 * and Win32 errors (0x0000 - 0xFFFF). This isn't required for
 * correctness, but may help debug a caller that is interpreting a raw
 * int incorrectly.
 *
 * Wherever the spec says "x may be the same value as y", we do use
 * the same value so that callers cannot not take a dependency on
 * being able to distinguish between them.
