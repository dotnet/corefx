        // Design:
        //
        // SingleProducerSingleConsumerQueue (SPSCQueue) is a concurrent queue designed to be used 
        // by one producer thread and one consumer thread. SPSCQueue does not work correctly when used by 
        // multiple producer threads concurrently or multiple consumer threads concurrently.
        // 
        // SPSCQueue is based on segments that behave like circular buffers. Each circular buffer is represented 
        // as an array with two indexes: _first and _last. _first is the index of the array slot for the consumer 
        // to read next, and _last is the slot for the producer to write next. The circular buffer is empty when 
        // (_first == _last), and full when ((_last+1) % _array.Length == _first).
        //
        // Since _first is only ever modified by the consumer thread and _last by the producer, the two indices can 
        // be updated without interlocked operations. As long as the queue size fits inside a single circular buffer, 
        // enqueues and dequeues simply advance the corresponding indices around the circular buffer. If an enqueue finds 
        // that there is no room in the existing buffer, however, a new circular buffer is allocated that is twice as big 
        // as the old buffer. From then on, the producer will insert values into the new buffer. The consumer will first 
        // empty out the old buffer and only then follow the producer into the new (larger) buffer.
        //
        // As described above, the enqueue operation on the fast path only modifies the _first field of the current segment. 
        // However, it also needs to read _last in order to verify that there is room in the current segment. Similarly, the 
        // dequeue operation on the fast path only needs to modify _last, but also needs to read _first to verify that the 
        // queue is non-empty. This results in true cache line sharing between the producer and the consumer.
        //
        // The cache line sharing issue can be mitigating by having a possibly stale copy of _first that is owned by the producer, 
        // and a possibly stale copy of _last that is owned by the consumer. So, the consumer state is described using 
        // (_first, _lastCopy) and the producer state using (_firstCopy, _last). The consumer state is separated from 
        // the producer state by padding, which allows fast-path enqueues and dequeues from hitting shared cache lines. 
        // _lastCopy is the consumer's copy of _last. Whenever the consumer can tell that there is room in the buffer 
        // simply by observing _lastCopy, the consumer thread does not need to read _last and thus encounter a cache miss. Only 
        // when the buffer appears to be empty will the consumer refresh _lastCopy from _last. _firstCopy is used by the producer 
        // in the same way to avoid reading _first on the hot path.
