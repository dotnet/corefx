    ///     This attribute allows you to configure a filter that is used enable or disable toolbox items
    ///     from being used on particular designers.  For example, you may have a class of components
    ///     that can only be used on a certain type of designer.  You can configure a toolbox item
    ///     filter to enforce that rule.  For example, take a report designer that uses a component
    ///     base class of ReportElement.  You may want to make ReportElement toolbox items enabled only
    ///     when a ReportDesigner is the active designer.  To do this, you would add the following
    ///     ToolboxItemFilter attributes to each class:
    ///
    ///     [ToolboxItemFilter("MyReportFilterString", ToolboxItemFilterType.Require)]
    ///     public class ReportElement : Component {}
    ///
    ///     [ToolboxItemFilter("MyReportFilterString", ToolboxItemFilterType.Require)]
    ///     public class ReportDesigner : Component {}
    ///     
    ///     These two filters specify that ReportElement toolbox items will only be 
    ///     enabled when a ReportDesigner is visible.  By specifying a filter type of
    ///     Require on the report designer class, this will disable any toolbox items
    ///     that are not report elements.  If the report designer specifed a filter type
    ///     of "Allow" instead of "Require", other components would be enabled when the
    ///     report designer was active.  ReportElements would still be disabled when 
    ///     other designers were active, however, because ReportElement requires designers
    ///     to have the given filter string.
    ///
    ///     Toolbox item filtering is a useful way to restrict toolbox item visibility to
    ///     cases where it is appropriate. This can help to avoid confusion for users, but
    ///     you should use caution not to make items unusually restrictive.  If you have a 
    ///     general purpose component, for example, you should allow the component to appear
    ///     on any designer.
    ///
    ///     The ASP.NET and Windows Forms designers both use filter attributes to prevent
    ///     each other's components from being enabled. This is a useful restriction because,
    ///     since each has several duplicate class names, it may be confusing to users and
    ///     they may not know which controls to choose.
