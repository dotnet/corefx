// Description:
//  This abstract class provides access to the "core properties" a Metro document.
//  The "core properties" are a subset of the standard OLE property sets
//  SummaryInformation and DocumentSummaryInformation, and include such properties
//  as Title and Subject.
//
//  There are two concrete derived classes. PackagePackageProperties represents the
//  core properties of a normal unencrypted Metro document, physically represented
//  as a Zip archive. EncryptedPackagePackageProperties represents the core properties
//  of an RM-protected Metro document, physically represented by an OLE compound
//  file containing a well-known stream in which a Metro Zip archive, encrypted
//  in its entirety, is stored.
