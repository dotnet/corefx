Compat issues with assembly System.Reflection.Emit.ILGeneration:
CannotRemoveAttribute : Attribute 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsReadOnlyAttribute' exists on 'System.Reflection.Emit.Label' in the contract but not the implementation.
TypeCannotChangeClassification : Type 'System.Reflection.Emit.Label' is marked as readonly in the contract so it must also be marked readonly in the implementation.
Total Issues: 2
