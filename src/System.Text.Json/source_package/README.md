# System.Text.Json Source Package

## Overview

* To support consumption of the `System.Text.Json` library outside of .NET Core 3.0+, we have produced a source package, `Microsoft.Bcl.Json.Sources`.
  - This package is unsupported and is only meant for advanced scenarios. Ideally, the project can target .NET Core 3.0 and get the inbox library.
  - It is intentionally not easy to consume such a package since we wanted to avoid any tooling or packaging magic to predict the user's intention.
    For simplicity, we recommended that you treat this like any other source file within your application or library.
  - We recommend that you do **NOT** modify the sources within the source package. Since they are consumed as a NuGet package, your changes would not be local to your project and will likely be lost on a package restore.

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Language Version

* The `System.Text.Json` sources are built using C# 7.3 language features and hence you will likely see the following errors:
  - `error CS8107: Feature 'default literal' is not available in C# 7.0. Please use language version 7.1 or greater.`
  - `error CS8107: Feature 'ref structs' is not available in C# 7.0. Please use language version 7.2 or greater.`
  - `error CS8320: Feature 'extensible fixed statement' is not available in C# 7.2. Please use language version 7.3 or greater.`

* Therefore, it is recommended that you update your compiler to one that supports C# 7.3+ and add the following attribute to your project:
  - `<LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>` OR `<LangVersion>7.3</LangVersion>`

### Unsafe Code

* The `System.Text.Json` sources are built using some unsafe code and hence you will likely see the following error:
  - `error CS0227: Unsafe code may only appear if compiling with /unsafe`

* Therefore, you will need the following attribute in your project (or something equivalent):
  - `<AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>`

### Missing Package References

* The `System.Text.Json` sources depend on the following packages:
  - `System.Memory`
  - `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`
  - `System.Buffers`
  - `System.Numerics.Vectors`

* You will likely see errors like the following when you don't have the required packages referenced in your application:
  - `error CS0103: The name 'Unsafe' does not exist in the current context`
  - `error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'ReadOnlySpan<>' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)`

* Therefore, you will need to add the following package references in your project:
  - `<PackageReference Include="System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe" Version="..." />`
  - `<PackageReference Include="System.Memory" Version="..." />`
  - The System.Memory package transitively brings in the other dependencies.

### CLS Compliance

* The `System.Text.Json` sources are built as part of a CLS Compliant library. Hence, they contain the `CLSCompliant` attributes in certain places.
  You might see warnings like the following (or errors if warnings are treated as errors):
  - `warning CS3021: 'Utf8JsonWriter.WriteNumber(string, ulong, bool)' does not need a CLSCompliant attribute because the assembly does not have a CLSCompliant attribute`

* You could either mark your project as CLSCompliant, or opt-out of this particular warning:
  - `<NoWarn>3021</NoWarn>` OR `<CLSCompliant>true</CLSCompliant>`

### Targeting .NET Core 3.0+

* The `System.Text.Json` library is built as part of .NET Core 3.0. If you reference this source package (unconditionally) and choose to target netcoreapp3.0 or higher,
  you might see lots of type conflict warnings (or errors if warnings are treated as errors):
  - `warning CS0436: The type 'JsonTokenType' in '...' conflicts with the imported type 'JsonTokenType' in 'System.Text.Json, Version=...'. Using the type defined in '...\microsoft.bcl.json.sources\...\JsonTokenType.cs'.`

* You should not reference this package if you are targeting .NET Core 3.0 or higher. If you are multi-targeting, then only conditionally include the package reference.
  Note that this applies to other package references that you include to fulfill the dependencies of the source package.

### PrivateAssets

* It is recommended that you mark your package reference as private so that this dependency does not accidentally leak outside of your package
  to applications that might be consuming it (for example, visible within the `deps.json`).
  ```csproj
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bcl.Json.Sources" Version="...">
     <PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>
  </PackageReference>
  ```

## Other Considerations

### InternalsVisibleTo

* Since the source package contains types marked as internal, please be intentional with the use of `InternalsVisibleTo`.
  It is acceptable to use it where necessary but something we wanted to highlight as an area of consideration.

## Sample Netstandard Library Project File

```csproj
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>
    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
    <!-- Suppress warnings for CLSCompliant OR add this attribute-->
    <!-- <CLSCompliant>true</CLSCompliant> -->
    <NoWarn>3021</NoWarn>
    <!-- Suppress warnings for S.T.Json types already defined in .NET Core 3.0, if your TFM is .NET Core 3.0+ (not recommended)
         OR preferably only conditionally include the package reference -->
    <!-- <NoWarn>0436</NoWarn> -->
  </PropertyGroup>

  <!-- If you are multi-targeting and include netcoreapp3.0 in your TFM, make sure this ItemGroup is only condtionally included. -->
  <!-- Note, the version numbers need to be filled in. -->
  <ItemGroup>
    <!-- Do not expose this dependency outside of your package to projects that might be consuming it (i.e. within deps.json). -->
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bcl.Json.Sources" Version="...">
      <PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe" Version="..." />
    <PackageReference Include="System.Memory" Version="..." />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```
