#DebuggableAttribute members need to be ported to System.Private.Corelib in .NETNative (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/9699) :
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Diagnostics.DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingFlags.get()' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Diagnostics.DebuggableAttribute.IsJITOptimizerDisabled.get()' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Diagnostics.DebuggableAttribute.IsJITTrackingEnabled.get()' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
