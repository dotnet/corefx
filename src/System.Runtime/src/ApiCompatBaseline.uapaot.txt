Compat issues with assembly System.Runtime:
TypeCannotChangeClassification : Type 'System.DateTimeOffset' is marked as readonly in the contract so it must also be marked readonly in the implementation.
TypeCannotChangeClassification : Type 'System.TimeSpan' is marked as readonly in the contract so it must also be marked readonly in the implementation.
TypeCannotChangeClassification : Type 'System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationEntry' is marked as readonly in the contract so it must also be marked readonly in the implementation.
