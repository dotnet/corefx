Compat issues with assembly System.Runtime:
TypesMustExist : Type 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallerArgumentExpressionAttribute' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
CannotMakeMoreVisible : Visibility of member 'System.Exception.HResult.set(System.Int32)' is 'Family' in the implementation but 'Public' in the contract.
