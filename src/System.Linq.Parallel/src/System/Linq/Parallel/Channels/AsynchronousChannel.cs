        // The producer will be blocked once the channel reaches a capacity, and unblocked
        // as soon as a consumer makes room. A consumer can block waiting until a producer
        // enqueues a new element. We use a chunking scheme to adjust the granularity and
        // frequency of synchronization, e.g. by enqueueing/dequeueing N elements at a time.
        // Because there is only ever a single producer and consumer, we are able to achieve
        // efficient and low-overhead synchronization.
        //
        // In general, the buffer has four logical states:
        //     FULL <--> OPEN <--> EMPTY <--> DONE
        //
        // Here is a summary of the state transitions and what they mean:
        //     * OPEN:
        //         A buffer starts in the OPEN state. When the buffer is in the READY state,
        //         a consumer and producer can dequeue and enqueue new elements.
        //     * OPEN->FULL:
        //         A producer transitions the buffer from OPEN->FULL when it enqueues a chunk
        //         that causes the buffer to reach capacity; a producer can no longer enqueue
        //         new chunks when this happens, causing it to block.
        //     * FULL->OPEN:
        //         When the consumer takes a chunk from a FULL buffer, it transitions back from
        //         FULL->OPEN and the producer is woken up.
        //     * OPEN->EMPTY:
        //         When the consumer takes the last chunk from a buffer, the buffer is
        //         transitioned from OPEN->EMPTY; a consumer can no longer take new chunks,
        //         causing it to block.
        //     * EMPTY->OPEN:
        //         Lastly, when the producer enqueues an item into an EMPTY buffer, it
        //         transitions to the OPEN state. This causes any waiting consumers to wake up.
        //     * EMPTY->DONE:
        //         If the buffer is empty, and the producer is done enqueueing new
        //         items, the buffer is DONE. There will be no more consumption or production.
        //
        // Assumptions:
        //   There is only ever one producer and one consumer operating on this channel
        //   concurrently. The internal synchronization cannot handle anything else.
