      the value of BuildNumber must be numeric and contain enough
      leading zeroes to satisfy a 16-bit integer in base-10 format.  this
      is needed because SemVer v1 performs a lexical comparison of the
      prerelease version number and without the leading zeroes foo-20 is
      smaller than foo-4.
