// Every member of this class is thread-safe.
// 
// Derived classes begin monitoring during construction, so that a user can know if the
// dependency changed any time after construction.  For example, suppose we have a
// FileChangeMonitor class that derives from ChangeMonitor.  A user might create an instance
// of FileChangeMonitor for an XML file, and then read the file to populate an object representation.
// The user would then cache the object with the FileChangeMonitor.  The user could optionally check the
// HasChanged property of the FileChangeMonitor, to see if the XML file changed while the object
// was being populated, and if it had changed, they could call Dispose and start over, without
// inserting the item into the cache.  However, in a multi-threaded environment, for cleaner, easier 
// to maintain code, it's usually appropriate to just insert without checking HasChanged, since the 
// cache implementer will handle this for you, and the next thread to attempt to get the object
// will recreate and insert it.
//
// The following contract must be followed by derived classes, cache implementers, and users of the
// derived class:
// 
// 1. The constructor of a derived class must set UniqueId, begin monitoring for dependency
//    changes, and call InitializationComplete before returning.  If a dependency changes
//    before initialization is complete, for example, if a dependent cache key is not found 
//    in the cache, the constructor must invoke OnChanged.  The constructor can only call
//    Dispose after InitializationComplete is called, because Dispose will throw 
//    InvalidOperationException if initialization is not complete.
// 2. Once constructed, the user must either insert the ChangeMonitor into an ObjectCache, or
//    if they're not going to use it, they must call Dispose.
// 3. Once inserted into an ObjectCache, the ObjectCache implementation must ensure that the
//    ChangeMonitor is eventually disposed.  Even if the insert is invalid, and results in an
//    exception being thrown, the ObjectCache implementation must call Dispose.  If this we're not
//    a requirement, users of the ChangeMonitor would need exception handling around each insert 
//    into the cache that carefully ensures the dependency is disposed.  While this would work, we
//    think it is better to put this burden on the ObjectCache implementer, since users are far more
//    numerous than cache implementers.
// 4. After the ChangeMonitor is inserted into a cache, the ObjectCache implementer must call 
//    NotifyOnChanged, passing in an OnChangedCallback.  NotifyOnChanged can only be called once, 
//    and will throw InvalidOperationException on subsequent calls.  If the dependency has already 
//    changed, the OnChangedCallback will be called when NotifyOnChanged is called.  Otherwise, the
//    OnChangedCallback will be called exactly once, when OnChanged is invoked or when Dispose
//    is invoked, which ever happens first.
// 5. The OnChangedCallback provided by the cache implementer should remove the cache entry, and specify
//    a reason of CacheEntryRemovedReason.DependencyChanged.  Care should be taken to remove the specific
//    entry having this dependency, and not it's replacement, which will have the same key.
// 6. In general, it is okay for OnChanged to be called at any time.  If OnChanged is called before 
//    NotifyOnChanged is called, the "state" from the original call to OnChanged will be saved, and the 
//    callback to NotifyOnChange will be called immediately when NotifyOnChanged is invoked.
// 7. A derived class must implement Dispose(bool disposing) to release all managed and unmanaged
//    resources when "disposing" is true.  Dispose(true) is only called once, when the instance is 
//    disposed.  The derived class must not call Dispose(true) directly--it should only be called by
//    the ChangeMonitor class, when disposed.  Although a derived class could implement a finalizer and 
//    invoke Dispose(false), this is generally not necessary.  Dependency monitoring is typically performed 
//    by a service that maintains a reference to the ChangeMonitor, preventing it from being garbage collected,
//    and making finalizers useless.  To help prevent leaks, when a dependency changes, OnChanged disposes
//    the ChangeMonitor, unless initialization has not yet completed.
// 8. Dispose() must be called, and is designed to be called, in one of the following three ways:
//    - The user must call Dispose() if they decide not to insert the ChangeMonitor into a cache.  Otherwise,
//      the ChangeMonitor will continue monitoring for changes and be unavailable for garbage collection.
//    - The cache implementor is responsible for calling Dispose() once an attempt is made to insert it.  
//      Even if the insert throws, the cache implementor must dispose the dependency.  
//      Even if the entry is removed, the cache implementor must dispose the dependency.
//    - The OnChanged method will automatically call Dispose if initialization is complete.  Otherwise, when
//      the derived class' constructor calls InitializationComplete, the instance will be automatically disposed.
//
//    Before inserted into the cache, the user must ensure the dependency is disposed.  Once inserted into the 
//    cache, the cache implementer must ensure that Dispose is called, even if the insert fails.  After being inserted
//    into a cache, the user should not dispose the dependency.  When Dispose is called, it is treated as if the dependency
//    changed, and OnChanged is automatically invoked.
// 9. HasChanged will be true after OnChanged is called by the derived class, regardless of whether an OnChangedCallback has been set
//    by a call to NotifyOnChanged.
