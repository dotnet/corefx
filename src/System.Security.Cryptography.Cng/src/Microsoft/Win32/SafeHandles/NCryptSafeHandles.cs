    ///     Base class for NCrypt handles which need to support being pseudo-duplicated. This class is not for
    ///     external use (instead applications should consume the concrete subclasses of this class).
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ///     Since NCrypt handles do not have a native DuplicateHandle type call, we need to do manual 
    ///     reference counting in managed code whenever we hand out an extra reference to one of these handles.
    ///     This class wraps up the logic to correctly duplicate and free these handles to simluate a native
    ///     duplication.
    /// 
    ///     Each open handle object can be thought of as being in one of three states:
    ///        1. Owner     - created via the marshaler, traditional style safe handle. Notably, only one owner
    ///                       handle exists for a given native handle.
    ///        2. Duplicate - points at a handle in the Holder state. Releasing a handle in the duplicate state
    ///                       results only in decrementing the reference count of the holder, not in a release
    ///                       of the native handle.
    ///        3. Holder    - holds onto a native handle and is referenced by handles in the duplicate state.
    ///                       When all duplicate handles are closed, the holder handle releases the native
    ///                       handle. A holder handle will never be finalized, since this results in a race
    ///                       between the finalizers of the duplicate handles and the holder handle. Instead,
    ///                       it relies upon all of the duplicate handles to be finalized and decriment the
    ///                       ref count to zero.  Instances of a holder handle should never be referenced by
    ///                       anything but a duplicate handle.
