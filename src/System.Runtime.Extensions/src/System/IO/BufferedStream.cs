    /// See a large comment in Write for the details of the write buffer heuristic.
    /// 
    /// This class buffers reads &amp; writes in a shared buffer.
    /// (If you maintained two buffers separately, one operation would always trash the other buffer
    /// anyways, so we might as well use one buffer.) 
    /// The assumption here is you will almost always be doing a series of reads or writes, but rarely
    /// alternate between the two of them on the same stream.

    /// Class Invariants:
    /// The class has one buffer, shared for reading &amp; writing.

    /// <![CDATA[
    ///   * 0 <= _readPos <= _readLen < _bufferSize
    ///   * 0 <= _writePos < _bufferSize
    ///   * _readPos == _readLen && _readPos > 0 implies the read buffer is valid, but we're at the end of the buffer.
    ///   * _readPos == _readLen == 0 means the read buffer contains garbage.
    ///   * Either _writePos can be greater than 0, or _readLen & _readPos can be greater than zero,
    ///     but neither can be greater than zero at the same time.

            //     Can the data already in the buffer and current user data be combines to a single write
            //     by allocating a "shadow" buffer of up to twice the size of _bufferSize (up to a limit to avoid LOH)?
            //     Yes, it can:
            //         Allocate a larger "shadow" buffer and ensure the buffered  data is moved there.
            //         Copy user data to the shadow buffer.
            //         Write shadow buffer to the underlying stream in a single operation.
            //     No, it cannot (amount of data is still too large):
            //         Write out any data possibly in the buffer.
            //         Write out user data directly.
            //

            // If the subsequent write operation that follows the current write operation will result in a write to the
            // underlying stream in case that we use the buffer in the current write, while it would not have if we avoided
            // using the buffer in the current write (by writing current user data to the underlying stream directly), then we
            // prefer to avoid using the buffer since the corresponding memory copy is wasted (it will not reduce the number
            // of writes to the underlying stream, which is what we are optimising for).
            // ASSUME that the next write will be for the same amount of bytes as the current write (most common case) and
