Compat issues with assembly System.Runtime.InteropServices:
CannotRemoveBaseTypeOrInterface : Type 'System.IO.UnmanagedMemoryStream' does not inherit from base type 'System.MarshalByRefObject' in the implementation but it does in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GenerateGuidForType(System.Type)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GenerateProgIdForType(System.Type)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetComObjectData(System.Object, System.Object)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetHINSTANCE(System.Reflection.Module)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetIDispatchForObject(System.Object)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetTypedObjectForIUnknown(System.IntPtr, System.Type)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.PtrToStringUTF8(System.IntPtr)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.PtrToStringUTF8(System.IntPtr, System.Int32)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SetComObjectData(System.Object, System.Object, System.Object)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.StringToCoTaskMemUTF8(System.String)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ZeroFreeCoTaskMemUTF8(System.IntPtr)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedType System.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedType.LPUTF8Str' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetExceptionPointers()' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetEndComSlot(System.Type)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.IsTypeVisibleFromCom(System.Type)' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
TypeCannotChangeClassification : Type 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef' is marked as readonly in the contract so it must also be marked readonly in the implementation.
