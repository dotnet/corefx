# .NET Core

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xje8bkekyu130e9y?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dotnet-bot/corefx)

This repository contains the class libraries for .NET Core. This is currently a
work in progress, and does not currently contain the entire set of libraries
that we plan on open sourcing. Make sure to watch this repository in order to be
notified as we make changes to and expand it. Check out this [blog post] that
explains our OSS strategy and road map in more detail.

Today, it contains the following components:

* **Immutable Collections**. A set of collection types that make it easy to keep
  mutable state under control without sacrificing performance or memory
  footprint. You can read more about them on [MSDN][immutable-msdn].

* **ECMA-335 Metadata Reader**. This is a highly tuned low-level metadata reader
  that allows [Roslyn] to parse assemblies.

* **SIMD enabled vector types**. We've recently added a set of basic vector
  types that leverage single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) CPU instructions.
  See our [recent][simd-post-1] [announcements][simd-post-2] for more details.

* **XML**. This includes the DOM APIs such as the `XDocument` and `XmlDocument`
  types, XLinq as well the corresponding XPath extension methods.

More is coming soon. Stay tuned!
