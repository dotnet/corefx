# .NET Core Libraries (CoreFX)

This repo contains the library implementation (called "CoreFX") for .NET Core. It includes System.Collections, System.IO, System.Xml, and many other components.
The corresponding [.NET Core Runtime repo](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) (called "CoreCLR") contains the runtime implementation for .NET Core. It includes RyuJIT, the .NET GC, and many other components.
Runtime-specific library code ([mscorlib](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/tree/master/src/mscorlib)) lives in the CoreCLR repo. It needs to be built and versioned in tandem with the runtime. The rest of CoreFX is agnostic of runtime-implementation and can be run on any compatible .NET runtime (e.g. [CoreRT](https://github.com/dotnet/corert)).

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, join in design conversations, and fix issues.

* [Dogfooding daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dogfooding.md)
* If you have a question or idea, [file a new issue](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/new).

If you are having issues with the "full" .NET Framework (also called "Desktop"), the best way to file a bug is the [Report a Problem](https://aka.ms/vs-rap) tool, which is integrated with the [VS Developer Community Portal](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/); or through [Product Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus?ws=support) if you have a contract.
