The corefx repo contains the library implementation (called "CoreFX") for [.NET Core](http://github.com/dotnet/core). It includes System.Collections, System.IO, System.Xml and many other components. It builds and runs on Windows. You can ['watch'](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/subscription) the repo to see Linux and Mac support being added over the next few months.

.NET Core is a modular implementation of .NET that can be used as the base stack for a wide variety of scenarios, today scaling from console utilities to web apps in the cloud.  You can learn more about .NET Core and how and where you can use it in the [.NET Core is open source][.NET Core oss] and [Introducing .NET Core][Introducing .NET Core] blog posts. 

The [.NET Core Runtime repo](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) contains the  runtime implementation (called "CoreCLR") for .NET Core. It includes RyuJIT, the .NET GC, native interop and many other components. 

Runtime-specific library code - namely [mscorlib][mscorlib] - lives in the CoreCLR repo. It needs to be built and versioned in tandem with the runtime. The rest of CoreFX is agnostic of runtime-implementation and can be run on any compatible .NET runtime. These characteristics were the primary motivation for the 2-repo structure.

## .NET Core Library Components

The repo contains the following components. More libraries are coming soon. ['Watch'](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/subscription) the repo to be notified.

* **System.Collections**. Provides classes that define generic collections, which allow developers to create 
  strongly-typed collections.

* **System.Collections.Concurrent**.  Provides a set of thread-safe collection types, instances of which may be used 
  concurrently from multiple threads.

* **System.Collections.Immutable**. Provides a set of immutable collection types that make it easy to keep
  mutable state under control without sacrificing performance or memory
  footprint. You can read more about them on [MSDN][immutable-msdn].

* **System.Collections.NonGeneric**.  Provides classes that define various collections of objects, such as ArrayList, 
  Hashtable, SortedList, Stack, and Queue. These collections exist in .NET Core primarily for backwards compatibility
  and generally should be avoided when writing new code.

* **System.Collections.Specialized**. Provides classes that define specialized collections of objects, for example, 
  a linked list dictionary, a bit vector, and collections that contain only strings. These collections exist in 
  .NET Core primarily for backwards compatibility and generally should be avoided when writing new code.

* **System.ComponentModel**. Provides interfaces for the editing and change tracking of objects used as data sources.

* **System.ComponentModel.Annotations**. Provides attributes that are used to define metadata for objects used as data sources.

* **System.ComponentModel.EventBasedAsync**. Provides support classes and delegates for the event-based asynchronous pattern. 
  This pattern and these supporting types exist in .NET Core primarily for backwards compatibility and generally should be
  avoided when writing new code.
  
* **System.ComponentModel.Primitives**. Provides interfaces that are used to implement the run-time and design-time behavior 
  of components.

* **System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter**. Provides the System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter class, which represents a unified 
  way of converting types of values to other types.

* **System.Console**. Provides the Console class, which enables access to the standard input,
  output, and error streams for console-based applications.

* **System.Diagnostics.Debug**. Provides a class to interact with the debugger as well as methods for performing runtime assertions.

* **System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo**. Provides useful functionality for querying
  and examining the version information of physical files on disk.

  stopping of local system processes.

* **System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener**. Provides trace listeners for directing tracing output to a text writer, 
  such as System.IO.StreamWriter.

* **System.Diagnostics.TraceSource**. Provides classes that help you trace the execution of your code.

  comparisons and support the use of non-ASCII characters for Internet domain names.

* **System.IO.Compression**. Provides classes that support the compression and decompression of streams.

* **System.IO.FileSystem**. Provides access to the file system, including support for enumerating and manipulating 
  file system objects and for reading and writing files via streams.

* **System.IO.FileSystem.DriveInfo**. Provides the System.IO.DriveInfo class, which enables developers to query 
  local drive information.

* **System.IO.FileSystem.Primitives**. Provides common enumerations and exceptions for path-based I/O libraries.

* **System.IO.FileSystem.Watcher**. Provides the System.IO.Watcher class, which listens to the system directory change 
  notifications and raises events when a directory or file within a directory changes.

* **System.IO.MemoryMappedFiles**. Provides access to memory-mapped files, enabling code to read and write files by
  reading and writing memory.

* **System.IO.Pipes**. Provides types that enable a means for interprocess communication through anonymous 
  and/or named pipes.

  to be represented as objects in the form of expression trees.

* **System.Linq.Parallel**.  Provides a parallelized implementation of LINQ to Objects. "Parallel LINQ" (PLINQ) 
  implements the full set of LINQ standard query operators as well as additional operators specific to parallel operations.

* **System.Linq.Queryable**. Provides LINQ standard query operators that operate on objects that implement ```IQueryable<T>```.

* **System.Numerics.Vectors**. Provides a set of basic vector types that leverage single instruction, 
  multiple data (SIMD) CPU instructions. See our [recent][simd-post-1] [announcements][simd-post-2] for more details.

* **System.ObjectModel**. Provides types and interfaces that enable the creation of observable types that provide
  notifications to clients when changes are made.

* **System.Reflection.DispatchProxy**. Provides a mechanism for dynamically creating proxy types that implement a 
  specified interface and derive from a specified DispatchProxy type.

  and allows you to connect to a running or stopped service, manipulate it, or get information about it.

* **System.Text.Encoding.CodePages**. Provides the ability to access existing encoding types for string manipulation 
  across common cultural standards, as well as support to create custom Encoding Providers.

* **System.Text.RegularExpressions**. Provides a regular expression engine. The types in this library provide useful 
  functionality for running common operations using regular expressions.

* **System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow**.  Provides a set of types that support actor/agent-oriented designs through 
  primitives for in-process message passing, dataflow, and pipelining.
