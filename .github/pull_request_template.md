<!-- ⛔ PLEASE READ BEFORE OPENING A NEW PULL REQUEST ⛔-->
<!--
We have moved to a new repository, [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime), where the source codes of both the shared libraries and the runtime live in. New pull requests should be opened in the new repository, unless this pull request targets already released versions of .NET Core (2.1 / 2.2 / 3.0 / 3.1) to backport bug fixes or improvements from the master branch. In such cases, please discuss with members of .NET team before opening a pull request.

Please take a look at [dotnet/announcements#119](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119), [dotnet/announcements#127](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/127) and [dotnet/runtime#253](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/253) for more details.
