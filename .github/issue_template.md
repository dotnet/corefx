## ğŸš«ğŸš«ğŸš« Please do not open new issues on this repo!!! ğŸš«ğŸš«ğŸš«
We have moved to a new repository, [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime), where the source codes of both the shared libraries and the runtime live in. All new issues / pull requests related with the runtime and the libraries should be opened in the new repository.

Please take a look at [dotnet/announcements#119](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119), [dotnet/announcements#127](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/127) and [dotnet/runtime#253](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/253) for more details.
