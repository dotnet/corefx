~~**[1]** **DONE in [[Pick issue]]** [Issues main page section](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Issues#main-page-section-content) is too long to be on the main page, we need to move the content into a subpage and keep the text sweet & short - basically few key links (topics), which can be easily used as reference for 2nd read.~~

**[2]** [Getting Started - Installation](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Getting-started#installing-the-necessary-workloads) - I would love to see there a bullet point list of a few things. We may need special version for Windows / Linux / Mac - maybe split into subpages?
  * The Installation page is used also as reference when you setup a new machine, or another OS for experiments - we should IMO optimize for that - sweet list of things (like other [Quick Reference](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Checking-out-the-code-repository#quick-reference))
  * Note: Installing VS is already Windows-only

- Working on creating subpages for each OS ... migrating Windows.
- I'm wondering if I should break up and re-use/re-write parts of the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/building/unix-instructions.md) for the quick reference section.
    * karelz: That sounds reasonable

~~**[3]** **DONE** [Getting Started - Installation](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Getting-started#installing-the-necessary-workloads) - "modify Visual Studio" - it doesn't say what/why to modify. Maybe it should be just a list of VS components that need to be installed in the "VS Install" step higher -- I would assume devs can figure out the 'modify' of installation. Maybe add it as Advanced trick / note?~~

~~**[4]** **DONE** - Delete duplicated content (overlap with new subpages)~~

~~**[5]** **DONE** [Build and run tests](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Build-and-run-tests) ... can you plz update the screenshot with search of 1 more letter - i.e. "deve" ... the "Device Manager" on top highlighted confused me quite a bit.~~

~~**[6]** **DONE** Move 'clean' into Advanced, it is not needed in typical dev workflow.~~

~~**[7]** **DONE** [Clone repository](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Checking-out-the-code-repository#clone-the-repository) - Make the cmd line screenshots smaller. To use similar font size as the web page screenshots. It will be still readable. In current form it stands out too much like a heading.~~

**[8]** Update NuGet cache size after sync - [sync details](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Build-and-run-tests#sync) and [Quick Reference](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Build-and-run-tests#quick-reference)
