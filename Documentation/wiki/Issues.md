# Notes, ideas

## Old docs

These docs may need updates:
  * [CoreFX repo issue guide](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/issue-guide.md)
  * [How we triage](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/triage.md)

## New content ideas
  * Random useful things:
    * This is not support replacement, Desktop is not tracked here
    * Expectations after filing new issue (first-response turnaround - in days, fix turnaround - milestone only)
    * How to understand labels, milestones
    * How to escalate important issue (for seasoned contributors) - tag @karelz / other repo-triagers, explain clearly why it is so important
    * Importance of upvotes (on top post) - they are input to prioritization (not the only one)
  * Issue guide
    * .NET Core product areas, various repos - https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/README.md
      * Note: Setup lives in CLI repo (not core-setup)
  * API review process
    * Adding APIs is hard: see HashCode example: https://twitter.com/terrajobst/status/799428189386747904
    * Which APIs belong / don't belong into CoreFX: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/18159#issuecomment-293105964
  * Motivation for formal API reviews and updating top post: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/4805#issuecomment-276447967
  * How we prioritize (incl. upvotes)
