Branching Guide
===============

We will have the following branches in the corefx repository:

* **master**
 * Where most development happens
 * Submit your PRs here unless you are adding API to a type that exists in the full .NET Framework

* **future**
 * Landing place for fully API and code reviewed changes that are not to be part of the next upcoming release.
 * Submit your PRs here if you're adding surface area to a type that has shipped in the full .NET Framework as we can no longer accept those changes and achieve our compatibility goal for the first release of .NET Core
 * Takes regular merges from master
 * Once we snap for the first release, we will merge future to master and delete future

* **release/[name]**
 * Release branches snapped from master. 
 * Do not submit pull requests to these branches
 * Fixes here do not flow to follow-up releases
 * Generally, fixes after a snap needing to make it in to a release will go in to master and get cherry-picked to the release branch.

* **dev/[name]** 
 * Features (aka topics) under active development by more than one developer.
 * Submit PRs here only if you've made prior arrangements to work on something in one of these branches.
 * It is up to the developers creating these branches to decide what level of review is required
 * These features will only ship if they are successfully pulled to master or future via the standard PR and API review process.
