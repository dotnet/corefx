# .NET Standard Platform (Preview)

## Why?
To provide a more concrete guarantee of binary portability to future .NET-capable platforms with an easier-to-understand platform versioning plan.

Today, Portable Class Libraries target an intersection of APIs depending on your platform selection when making the project. This gives you a specific surface area that guarantees you work on the chosen platforms. Those combinations are precomputed to give you the right set of surface area. When these portable libraries are packaged into NuGet, they are expressed with a static set of frameworks e.g. **portable-net45+win8**. While this describes the intent that you want to run on .NET Framework 4.5 and Windows 8.0, it is also restrictive, since new platforms can appear in the future that are perfectly capable of running those PCLs but are blocked due to the platforms that were selected when the project was created. In fact, putting the portable dll inside of a folder with a static list of profiles *essentially* makes it platform-specific. It's no different to doing:

```
MyLibrary/net45/MyLibrary.dll
MyLibrary/win8/MyLibrary.dll
```

The biggest difference is that you wouldn't be able to consume it in a Portable Class Library project type.

The .NET Standard Platform version represents binary portability across platforms using a **single** moniker. They are an evolution of the existing Portable Class Library system. They are "open-ended" in that they aren't tied down to a static list of monikers like **portable-a+b+c** is.

.NET Standard Platform versions are not too different to the PortableXXX profiles people use today which get represented in NuGet as **portable-a+b+c** (eg. Profile111). The key difference is that the **single** .NET Standard Platform moniker evolves and versions linearly, such that NuGet and other tools can infer compatibility, i.e. newer .NET Standard Platform versions are compatible with older ones.


## Terms
- **PCL** - Portable Class Library
- **Platform** - e.g. .NET Framework 4.5, Windows Phone 8.1
- **Reference Assembly** - An assembly that contains API surface only. There is no IL in the method bodies. It is used for compilation only, and cannot be used to run. Also commonly referred to as "Contracts".
- **Implementation Assembly** - An assembly that contains an implementation of a reference assembly. These are usually implemented in the platform itself and cannot be updated without updating the platform.
- **.NET Standard Platform** - versioned sets of the reference assemblies.
- **Cross compile** - to compile the same source code files to different target platforms, i.e. against different API sets.

## Principles
- Platform owners implement reference assemblies from a particular .NET Standard Platform version.
- Platform owners may implement a subset of reference assemblies from a particular .NET Standard Platform version.
- Any change in a reference assembly's API surface causes the .NET Standard Platform to version.
- Lower versions are always compatible with higher versions.

## Existing .NET Standard Platform versions
Mapping the .NET Standard Platform to existing platforms versions.

In general class libraries which target a lower .NET Standard Platform version like 5.1 can be loaded by the largest number of older target platforms, but will have access to a more limited, older set of system APIs. On the other hand class libraries which target a higher .NET Standard Platform version like 5.4 can be loaded by a smaller number of newer target platforms, but will have access to a larger, more recent set of system APIs. 

| Target Platform Name | Alias |  |  |  |  |  |
| :---------- | :--------- |:--------- |:--------- |:--------- |:--------- |:--------- |
|.NET Standard Platform | dotnet | 5.1 | 5.2 | 5.3 | 5.4 | 5.5 |
|.NET Framework|net|?|4.5|||
|||?|?|4.5.1||
|||?|?|4.5.2||
|||?|?|?|4.6||
|||?|?|?|?|4.6.x|
|Windows|win|?|8.0|||
|||?|?|8.1||
|Windows Phone|wpa|?|8.0|||
|||?|?|8.1||
|Windows Phone Silverlight|wp|8.0||||
|||8.1||||
|Universal Windows Platform|uap|?|?|?|10.0|
|DNX Core|dnxcore|?|?|?|?|5.0|
|Mono/Xamarin Platforms||?|?|?|?|*|
|Mono||?|?|*|||

### Observations

- If a library targets .NET Standard Platform version 5.4, it can *only* run on .NET Framework 4.6 or later, Universal Windows Platform 10 (UWP), DNX Core 5.0 and Mono/Xamarin platforms. 
- If a library targets .NET Standard Platform version 5.4, it can consume libraries from all previous .NET Standard Platform versions (5.3, 5.2, 5.1).
- The earliest .NET Framework to support a .NET Standard Platform version is .NET Framework 4.5. This is because the new portable API surface area (aka **System.Runtime** based surface area) that is used as the foundation for .NET Standard Platform only became available in that version of .NET Framework. Targeting .NET Framework <= 4.0 requires cross-compilation.
- Each .NET Standard Platform version enables more API surface, which means it's available on fewer platforms. As the platforms update, their newer versions jump up into newer .NET Standard Platform versions.
- Platforms which have stopped updating -- like Silverlight on Windows Phone -- will only ever be available in the earliest .NET Standard Platform versions.

### Portable Profiles

PCL projects will be able to consume packages built for .NET Standard Platform (dotnet5.x) but not vice versa. The table below outlines the mapping of PCL portable profiles to the supported .NET Standard Platform version.

| Profile | .NET Standard Platform version |
| ---------| --------------- |
| Profile7	.NET Portable Subset (.NET Framework 4.5, Windows 8) | 5.2 |
| Profile31	.NET Portable Subset (Windows 8.1, Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1)| 5.1|
| Profile32	.NET Portable Subset (Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1) | 5.3 |
| Profile44	.NET Portable Subset (.NET Framework 4.5.1, Windows 8.1) | 5.3 |
| Profile49	.NET Portable Subset (.NET Framework 4.5, Windows Phone Silverlight 8) | 5.1 |
| Profile78	.NET Portable Subset (.NET Framework 4.5, Windows 8, Windows Phone Silverlight 8) | 5.1 |
| Profile84	.NET Portable Subset (Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1) | 5.1 |
| Profile111 .NET Portable Subset (.NET Framework 4.5, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1) | 5.2 |
| Profile151 .NET Portable Subset (.NET Framework 4.5.1, Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1) | 5.3 |
| Profile157 .NET Portable Subset (Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1) | 5.1 |
| Profile259 .NET Portable Subset (.NET Framework 4.5, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Phone Silverlight 8) | 5.1 |

**NOTE: Xamarin Platforms augment the existing profile numbers above.**

Exising PCL projects in VS2013 and VS2015 (excluding UWP targets), can only target up to .NET Standard Platform version 5.3. To build libraries for .NET Standard Platform version >= 5.4 you have 2 options:

- Use project.json in csproj-based projects
- Use xproj-based projects, i.e. "Class Library (Package)" project template

## NuGet

### .NET Standard Platform version mapping

| .NET Standard Platform version | NuGet identifier |
| ---------| --------------- |
| 5.1 - 5.5 | dotnet5.1 - dotnet5.5 |

### Specific platform mapping

| Platform | NuGet identifier |
| ---------| --------------- |
| .NET Framework 2.0 - 4.6 | net20 - net46 |
|.NET Micro Framework | netmf |
| Windows 8 | win8, netcore45 |
| Windows 8.1 | win8, netcore451 |
| Windows Phone Silverlight (8, 8.1) | wp8, wp81 |
| Windows Phone 8.1 | wpa8.1 |
| Universal Windows Platform 10 | uap10, netcore50 |
| DNX on .NET Framework 4.5.1 - 4.6 | dnx451 - dnx46 |
| DNX on .NET Core 5.0 | dnxcore50  |
| Silverlight 4, 5 | sl4, sl5 |
| MonoAndroid | monoandroid |
| MonoTouch | monotouch |
| MonoMac | monomac |
| Xamarin iOS | xamarinios |
| Xamarin PlayStation 3 | xamarinpsthree | 
| Xamarin PlayStation 4 | xamarinpsfour |
| Xamarin PlayStation Vita | xamarinpsvita |
| Xamarin Watch OS | xamarinwatchos |
| Xamarin TV OS | xamarintvos |
| Xamarin Xbox 360 | xamarinxboxthreesixty |
| Xamarin Xbox One | xamarinxboxone |

### Deprecated monikers

| Platform | NuGet identifier |
| ---------| --------------- |
| ASP.NET 5.0 on .NET Framework | aspnet50 |
| ASP.NET 5.0 on .NET Core | aspnetcore50 |
| Windows 8 | winrt |

### Package authoring
When building a NuGet package, specifing folders named for platform monikers is enough to indicate what platforms your package targets.

MyPackage
```
MyPackage/lib/dotnet5.4/MyPackage.dll
```

The above package targets .NET Platform 5.4 (.NET Standard Platform 5.4)

#### Migrating existing PCLs in NuGet packages
Using the table outlined above, use the profile number of the csproj used to build the portable assembly to determine what NuGet folder it should go into. For example, **Newtonsoft.Json 7.0.1** has 2 portable folders:

```
Newtonsoft.Json/7.0.1/lib/portable-net40+sl5+wp80+win8+wpa81/Newtonsoft.Json.dll
Newtonsoft.Json/7.0.1/lib/portable-net45+wp80+win8+wpa81+dnxcore50/Newtonsoft.Json.dll
```

Only one of these can be converted to a dotnet5.x based reference. Based on this csproj, we can see that the second PCL project is really profile 259.

https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/blob/d4916a76b5ed94342944cc665372dcc5dbd9e389/Src/Newtonsoft.Json/Newtonsoft.Json.Portable.csproj#L12

```
Newtonsoft.Json/7.0.1/lib/portable-net40+sl5+wp80+win8+wpa81/Newtonsoft.Json.dll
Newtonsoft.Json/7.0.1/lib/dotnet5.1/Newtonsoft.Json.dll
```

#### Generating dependency references

Unlike previous PCL packages, targeting the .NET Standard Platform requires the package dependencies to be fully specified. The specific version of the dependency doesn't matter but stating the dependency does. To aid in making this simple in the short term [Oren Novotny](https://github.com/onovotny) built a tool that can be used to generate the correct depenencies for nuspec metadata for your .NET Standard Platform based projects/assemblies:

https://github.com/onovotny/ReferenceGenerator

We expect to have something like this built into the Visual Studio project system as a first class experience in the future.

#### Bait and switch

**PCLCrypto** is a popular NuGet package that provides portable surface area via the [bait and switch technique](http://ericsink.com/entries/pcl_bait_and_switch.html). Usually, it's done with a number of platform-specific folders (the switch) and a portable folder (the bait) that is used for compilation (reference assembly):

```
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/Xamarin.iOS/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/monoandroid/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/monotouch/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/win81/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/wp8/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/wpa81/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/portable-win8+wpa81+wp80+MonoAndroid10+xamarinios10+MonoTouch10/PCLCrypto.dll
```

When referencing this library from a PCL project, the portable-* dll is used for compilation. This is to allow other PCLs to be written against a consistent surface area across platforms. When referencing this package from a specific platform, the platform-specific implementation is chosen.

With .NET Standard Platform versions, and NuGet v3, we have introduced a more formal approach to making these kinds of packages. PCLCrypto would change to look like the following:

```
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/Xamarin.iOS/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/monoandroid/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/monotouch/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/win81/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/wp8/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/lib/wpa81/PCLCrypto.dll
PCLCrypto/1.0.80/ref/dotnet5.1/PCLCrypto.dll
```

The `ref` folder (`ref` being short for "reference assembly") is used to instruct the compiler what assembly should be used for compilation. The .NET Standard Platform version should be chosen such that it covesr all of the specific platforms in the package (as indicated by the other sub-folders of "lib").

### Guard rails (supports)
In order to support platforms that implement a subset of the reference assemblies in a .NET Standard Platform version, **guard rails** were introduced to help class library authors predict where their libraries will run. As an example, let's introduce a new platform: **.NET Banana 1.0**. **.NET Banana 1.0** indicates it is based on .NET Standard Platform 5.4, but it did not implement the `System.AppContext` reference assembly. Class libraries authors targeting .NET Standard Platform version 5.4 need to know that their package may not work on **.NET Banana 1.0**.

```JSON
{
   "supports": [
      ".NET Banana 1.0"
   ],
   "dependencies": {
      "System.AppContext": "5.0.0"
   },
   "frameworks": {
      "dotnet5.4": { }
   } 
}
```

The above `project.json` will cause NuGet to do a compatibiltiy check, enforcing that an implementation assembly for `System.AppContext` can be found on **.NET Banana 1.0**. If this dependency check fails, you have 2 options:

1. Don't support **.NET Banana 1.0**
2. Cross compile for **.NET Banana 1.0** by adding that framework **explicitly** (this is only supported in xproj today) and use the platform-specific alternative to the `System.AppContext` API (if one exists).
```JSON
{
   "frameworks": {
      "dotnet5.4": { 
         "dependencies": {
            "System.AppContext": "5.0.0"
         }
      },
      "netbanana1.0": { }
   } 
}
```

## List of .NET CoreFx APIs and their associated .NET Standard Platform version (tentative)

### Legend 
- `X` - API appeared in specific .NET Standard Platform version
- `?` - API version determined by nearest `X` e.g. In the table below, if you target .NET Standard Platform version 5.5 and reference Microsoft.CSharp, you'd get the 5.1 API version.
