        List of container files that will be opened and checked for files that need to be signed.

        Note that we use $(ArtifactsDir)packages instead of $(ArtifactsPackagesDir) because the later
        includes $(Configuration) which is actually different for each of our package outputs compared
        to what is in when we run the Sign.proj. Corefx encodes more then just Debug/Release into the
        Configuration property so we simply need to glob everything under packages.
