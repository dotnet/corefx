    <!-- This package will generate validation issues since we usually try to consume same-day packages from corefx that will have a higher
         version than locally built packages. Validation will assume incorrectly that you are downgrading the reference which is why this error is flagged.
         Since it isn't really an error, we will supress it in order to unblock same-day package ingestion. -->
